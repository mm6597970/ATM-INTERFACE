🏧 ATM Interface in Java – #CodSoft Internship Project

As part of my virtual internship at #CodSoft, I built an ATM Interface using core Java concepts. This project simulates basic ATM operations with a simple and intuitive console-based UI.

Key Features:
🔹 Withdraw, Deposit, and Check Balance options
🔹 Separate classes for the ATM and Bank Account
🔹 Methods like withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance()
🔹 Input validation to handle insufficient funds or invalid entries
🔹 User-friendly messages for successful and failed transactions

This project helped reinforce my understanding of OOP in Java, method design, and interactive user input handling.

Excited to keep learning and building more! 💻✨
